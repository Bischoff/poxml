      "&kwrite; is more than a text editor for the KDE Desktop. It is meant\n"
      "to be a programmer's editor, and could be considered as at least a partial\n"
      "alternative to more powerful editors.  It may be best used in conjunction\n"
      "with &konqueror; for source file browsing for\n"
      "different languages. &kwrite; also works very well as a simple text editor.\n"
      "One of &kwrite;'s main features is the colorized syntax, customized for\n"
      "many different programming languages such as: C/C++, &Java;, Python, Perl,\n"
      "Bash, Modula 2, <acronym>HTML</acronym>, and Ada."
