msgid "&kwrite; is more than a text editor for the KDE Desktop. It is meant to be a programmer's editor, and could be considered as at least a partial alternative to more powerful editors. It may be best used in conjunction with &konqueror; for source file browsing for different languages. &kwrite; also works very well as a simple text editor. One of &kwrite;'s main features is the colorized syntax, customized for many different programming languages such as: C/C++, &Java;, Python, Perl, Bash, Modula 2, <acronym>HTML</acronym>, and Ada."
